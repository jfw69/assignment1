This is an individual assignment – each student must submit their own solutions for credit.

[60] Download and install Unity 6000.0.44f1 Personal (including the preselected targets plus “WebGL Build Support” and any other desired platform support) either from the Unity Hub (recommended) or directly from here:
https://unity.com/releases/editor/qa/lts-releasesLinks to an external site.

This specific version was chosen for its stability and because it’s compatible with the tutorials for Assignments 1 and 2.  It will also be critical that we’re all using the same version for the term project.  We’ll need the WebGL support for later in the term, so might as well install it now!

Next, do this:

[30] Add a ball “double jump” ability to your project, triggered by the spacebar. Specifically, the ball should be able to jump when in contact with the ground and then jump exactly once more before returning to contact with the ground. There are many ways to implement this, so do some research and have fun!
Feel free to customize the look and feel of your project by adjusting colors, lighting, assets, etc.  Be creative!

[10] Create a GitHub repository for your project using the Unity .gitignore template. Commit (and push) all files/directories in your project directory (the .gitignore will ensure that unnecessary files aren’t included).
Submit a link to your *public* repo for Assignment 1 on Canvas.
